# mtk-sony-backup-script
Backs up Mediatek based Sony Phones when run as root. see mtk-su for that.
Now an old script to assist backing up Sony Mediatek devices. 
Needs root privileges to run. 
Worked well with MTK-SU upto Android 8.0
Push to /data/tmp/ give it the necessary privileges (chmod 755) & execute.
Read the script for details as I talked myself through it when creating it.
